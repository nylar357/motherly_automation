First we need to place the script that actually does the work in your documents folder, that is the ```vpncon.sh``` script above this window.  You can download it or copy and paste it into the : ```/home/user1/documents/``` or ```Home -> Documents ->``` if your using a file manager.


This is going to be a simple little task of creating some keyboard shortcuts to connect & disconnect from the vpn

Menu > Settings > System Settings or All Settings > Shortcuts > Press the ïƒ¾ (Plus Button See Photo)

Click the + button(in previous image). The Add Custom Shortcut window will appear:
Add a custom shortcut

Type a Name to identify the shortcut, and a Command to run an application.

Click the Set Shortcut .... When the Set Custom Shortcut window opens, hold down the desired shortcut key combination.
I'd reccommend  

Connect Shortcut

```Name : Connect to ProtonVPN```

```Command : xfce4-terminal -x bash /home/user1/documents/vpncon.sh -1``` 

```Shortcut : Super/Windows Button + c```

Disconnect Shortcut

```Name : Disconnect from ProtonVPN```

```Command : xfce4-terminal -x bash /home/user1/documents/vpncon.sh -2 = Disconnect from VPN```

```Shortcut : Super/Windows Button + d```

Display Shortcuts

```Name : Keyboard Shortcuts Displayed```

```Command : xfce4-terminal -x bash /home/user1/documents/vpncon.sh -3 = Fetching Shortcuts```

```Shortcut : Super/Windows Button + s```

Run Script Standalone 

This is a choiced bash script, so there are 3 choices. Example Connect Usage : ./vpncon.sh -1  . This is 
par for the linux operating system when running applications in the terminal, option with a shorthand called
the argument.  Usually the option itself will work as well, but not in this case.

 |   option   |  argument   | 
 | :--------- | ----------: | 
 | connect    |      -1     |
 | disconnect |      -2     |
 | shortcuts  |      -3     |
  
  Steps to follow while connecting, obviously country & state are your choice, I reccommend to you to just use UDP, its much much safer and there isn't any drawbacks compared to TCP, at least not for your normal use.
  
1. Country Choice
